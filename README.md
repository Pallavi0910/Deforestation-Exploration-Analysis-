# Deforestation-Exploration-Analysis-
Project Description:

ForestQuery, a non-profit organization, on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world and which raises awareness about this important environmental topic.
Executive director and her leadership team members are looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area. 

ForestQuery has obtained data from the World Bank that includes forest area and total land area by country and year from 1990 to 2016, as well as a table of countries and the regions to which they belong.

I have used SQL to bring these tables together and to query them in an effort to find areas of concern as well as areas that present an opportunity to learn from
successes.
